# AI/LLM Context Folder

This folder contains structured documentation to help AI/LLM agents (and human developers) quickly understand the Questra project. It serves as a "quick-start guide" for any AI assistant working on this codebase.

## Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `project-overview.md` | High-level summary of what Questra is, its vision, tech stack, and current status |
| `codebase-map.md` | File/folder structure documentation — what each part of the codebase does |
| `decisions-log.md` | Architectural decision log tracking key choices and changes over time |

## How to Use

- **Starting a new task?** Read `project-overview.md` first for context, then `codebase-map.md` to understand the structure.
- **Making architectural decisions?** Log them in `decisions-log.md` with date, context, and rationale.
- **Onboarding a new AI agent or developer?** Point them to this folder first.

## Maintenance

These files should be updated whenever significant changes are made to the project structure, architecture, or direction. Keep them concise but comprehensive.
